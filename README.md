# GpLearn_WaveSetup
Using of [GpLearn Model](https://github.com/trevorstephens/gplearn) to identify a mathematical expression that best describes the wave setup. The dataset used was compiled by Stockdon et al.(2006) (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378383906000044) and can be found in Stockdon & Holman (2011) (https://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/602/) and also can be downloaded from Coastal and Ocean Collective (https://coastalhub.science/data}/Wave Runup Field Data).
